#Intro to Databases
* What is a database?
    * A collection of information/data
    * Has an interface
* SQL vs. NoSQL
    * SQL (Relational)
        * Tabular and flat
        * Fairly inflexible - you have to define tabs ahead of time
    * NoSQL (Non-relational)
        * Very flexible - we don't have to define tabs ahead of time
        * Ex: 
            {
                name: "Ira",
                age: 24,
                city: Missoula,
